Advanced Regression Analysis:
Load Data:

Open JMP and load your dataset.
Navigate to Fit Model:

Under the Analyze menu, choose Fit Model.
Specify Response and Predictors:

Select your dependent variable (response) and independent variables (predictors).
Click "Run" to generate a basic regression model.
Explore Model Options:

Customize the model by adding interaction terms, polynomial terms, or other transformations using the red triangle menu.
Validate Model:

Use diagnostic plots and statistics (available in the red triangle menu) to validate assumptions such as normality, homoscedasticity, and independence of residuals.
Advanced Regression Techniques:

In the "Personality" panel of the "Fit Model" platform, explore options for advanced regression techniques like Ridge Regression, LASSO, or Elastic Net.
Classification Analysis:
Navigate to Fit Model:

Under the Analyze menu, choose Fit Model.
Specify Response and Predictors:

Select your categorical dependent variable (response) and independent variables (predictors).
Choose Classification Model:

In the "Personality" panel, choose a classification method like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Model Comparison:

Use the "Compare Models" option in the red triangle menu to compare different classification models.
Model Validation:

Use cross-validation or other validation methods available in the red triangle menu to assess the model's performance.
Model Deployment:
Deploy Model:
After selecting the best-fitting model, deploy it for prediction.
Go to the "Deploy" section in the "Fit Model" platform to apply the model to new data.
