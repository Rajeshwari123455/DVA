Prediction Profiler:

Load Data:
Open JMP and load the dataset containing process conditions and responses.

Fit a Model:
Under the Analyze menu, choose Fit Model.
Select the response variable and predictors.
Use the Prediction Profiler in the red triangle menu to visualize the effect of predictor variables on the response.

Explore Desirability:
Utilize the Desirability Profiler to identify the combination of process conditions that maximizes the desirability.

Monte Carlo Simulation:

Specify Variables:
In the Fit Model report, go to the red triangle menu and choose Simulate Y > By Design.
Specify the variables for which you want to perform the simulation.

Set Number of Runs:
Choose the number of Monte Carlo runs in the dialog box.
Specify the distribution for each variable if needed.

Run Simulation:
Click "OK" to run the Monte Carlo simulation.

Analyze Results:
Examine the distribution of the response variable and understand the variability in the predicted outcomes under different conditions.

Simulation Experiment:

Define Factors:
Under the Simulate menu, choose Define Factor Settings to set up factors and their levels.

Specify Responses:
Specify the responses you want to study during the simulation experiment.

Design Experiment:
Use the Custom Design option to create an experimental design for the simulation experiment.

Run Simulation Experiment:
Go to the Simulate menu and choose Run Simulation Experiment.

Analyze Results:
Use the Profiler to visualize the effects of different factors on responses.
Evaluate the desirability under various conditions.

Optimize Using Response Surface Methodology (Optional):

Fit Response Surface Model:
Use the Fit Model platform and select the Response Surface Design option to fit a response surface model.

Optimize Desirability:
Use the Response Optimizer in the red triangle menu to find the optimal process conditions that maximize desirability.
