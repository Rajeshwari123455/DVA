Step 1: Import Your Data
Open JMP and go to File > Open to import your dataset.
Select your data file and choose the appropriate options for importing (e.g., CSV, Excel).

Step 2: Explore Data Overview
Once your data is loaded, go to the Explore menu.
Click on Exploration to get an overview of your data, including summary statistics and visualizations.

Step 3: Create Basic Graphs
Navigate to the Graph menu.
Choose the type of graph you want to create (e.g., histogram, scatterplot, box plot).
Drag and drop variables from the data table onto the graph to specify the axes and customize the appearance.

Step 4: Dynamic Data Filtering
Use the Filter option to dynamically subset your data based on specific criteria.
Click on the filter icon next to a variable, set conditions, and observe how the graphs update dynamically.

Step 5: Interactive Maps
If your data includes geographical information, go to the Graph menu.
Choose Map to create an interactive map.
Drag and drop variables to define the map's features and colors.

Step 6: Advanced Graphs and Reports
Explore more advanced graphs under the Graph menu, such as contour plots or bubble plots.
Use the Fit Y by X option to explore relationships between variables and fit regression lines.
Create reports by selecting relevant graphs and going to File > New Report.

Step 7: Dashboard Creation
Combine multiple graphs into a dashboard for a comprehensive view.
Go to Window > New Dashboard and drag graphs onto the dashboard space.
Customize the layout and appearance of the dashboard.

Step 8: Sharing and Exporting
Once satisfied with your analysis, go to File > Save to save your JMP project.
To share results, you can export individual graphs or the entire report as images, PDFs, or HTML.

Step 9: Scripting (Optional)
For more advanced users, consider exploring the JMP scripting language (JSL) to automate analyses and create customized solutions.
